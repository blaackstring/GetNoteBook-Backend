Interdependence means that firms are mutually dependent on each other’s decisions. Since only a few large firms exist in an oligopolistic market, any change in price, output, or strategy by one firm directly affects the others. As a result, firms must consider competitors’ possible reactions before making decisions, leading to strategic behavior and limited independence.

An oligopoly is a distinct market structure characterized by a small number of powerful firms that dominate an entire industry. Common examples include the airline, telecommunications, and automobile industries. The most critical feature of an oligopoly is interdependence. Unlike firms operating under perfect competition or monopoly, an oligopolist cannot act in isolation. Every major decision—such as setting prices, determining output levels, or launching advertising campaigns—has a direct impact on the market position and profitability of rival firms. Consequently, firms must constantly anticipate and respond to the strategic actions of their competitors.

This strong mutual dependence often results in price rigidity, where prices remain stable despite changes in production costs. The kinked demand curve model explains this phenomenon by assuming asymmetric reactions to price changes. If a firm raises its price, competitors are likely to keep their prices unchanged, causing the firm to lose a significant share of customers. On the other hand, if a firm lowers its price, rivals quickly match the reduction to protect their market share, eliminating any competitive advantage. This creates a kink in the demand curve and discourages frequent price changes, pushing firms to compete through non-price strategies such as product quality and branding.

To analyze such strategic interactions, economists use game theory, which examines decision-making under mutual dependence. A classic example is the Prisoner’s Dilemma, which highlights the conflict between individual incentives and collective benefits. Although firms in an oligopoly could gain higher profits through collusion by jointly setting high prices, each firm has an incentive to cheat by undercutting others to increase its market share. Because firms cannot fully trust one another, collusive agreements are often unstable, leading to competitive outcomes and lower overall profits.
